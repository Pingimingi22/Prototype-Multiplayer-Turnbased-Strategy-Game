# About
This project started as a way for me to get some practice working with CMake (this is why the repo is a mess). Currently I don't have much time to spend working on this project due to me working on my final assessment for school, but it does have some cool features implemented. Right now you can successfully connect up to 2 people to a game and can create villagers.

# CMake
Right now the project isn't really a CMake project due to some version control issues... But! I do plan on making CMake work. I started off building this with CMake but when I built a Visual Studio Project with it early on, I started adding libraries and headers into the Visual Studio Project directly. This made me have to retreat from CMake until I can write my CMakeLists.txt to match the Visual Studio Project properties.
